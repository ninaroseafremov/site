What I like to do Read fiction and nonfiction alike Write creatively Work on learning foreign languages Run Goals Get my degrees Learn Ukrainian Become a better writer + communicator Importance of WRIT 4662w Since declaring this major and seeing that WRIT 4662w was a required, I recall being intrigued by this course. With communication taking on a digital form more and more often these days, I assumed that this course would be extremely useful in helping me achieve some of my goals and become a more competent writer and communicator. Over the course of this semester, I learned about the role of digital technologies in technical writing from a more in depth and hands on perspective; I know that this experience will be extremely useful in whichever profession I choose to pursue upon graduation in a year's time. I had the opportunity to pursue several different softwares and platforms, two of which I will touch upon in this site: structured authoring with DITA and my first static site.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"","title":"About Me"},{"location":"about/#the-gist","text":"I'm a junior at the University of Minnesota pursuing a BS in Technical Writing, a BA in Russian Studies, and an English minor.","title":"The Gist"},{"location":"about/#what-i-like-to-do","text":"Read fiction and nonfiction alike Write creatively Work on learning foreign languages Run","title":"What I like to do"},{"location":"about/#goals","text":"Get my degrees Learn Ukrainian Become a better writer + communicator","title":"Goals"},{"location":"about/#importance-of-writ-4662w","text":"Since declaring this major and seeing that WRIT 4662w was a required, I recall being intrigued by this course.

I did so using the Oxygen XML developer. I would say that this was my favorite assignment for this class. Over the course of the pandemic, we all picked up new hobbies to keep ourselves entertained as we stayed home. For fun, I became an amateur bartender. This assignment was a productive way to share some things that I picked up concerning my new hobby. While I was at first overwhelmed with the new software, it became quite fun to explore once I got the hang of navigating Oxygen. I also had the opportunity to help some of my peers work with Oxygen; I had to ask people for help fairly often over the course of WRIT 4662w, so it felt nice to help them in return.

In order to do this, I had to learn the basics of html and css. I also learned how to publish my site using Github. This at first seemed very daunting. My digital literacy admittedly wasn't super advanced before this course and while I had experimented with html once in a browser, I didn't know really where to start with this project. However, using course resources, online tutorials, and advice from my friends, I managed to make something I felt good about. Once I had atom downloaded and began the Linkedin html course, the rest seemed to fall together. I know feel confident with the very basics of html. Once I had all my html files finished, I then moved over to creating a css file. I found online forums to me the most useful in figuring out the basics of css. As far as using Github, this was the easiest part of the project for me. Usually it takes me same repetition to pick up on new technical aspects, just like with learning a language, but uploading my files to a repository on Github went fairly smoothly. I wish to revise my portfolio, or make a completely new one using the minimalist design of mkdocs, but here is a link to my static website/portfolio","title":"Static Site"},{"location":"staticsite/#static-site","text":"One of our very first assignments for this course was to create a static site.
